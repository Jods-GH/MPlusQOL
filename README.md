### MPlusQOL

MPlusQOL is a bundle of Mythic plus Quality of life additions. Many of which were previously WeakAuras that I was missing.


### Features

- Repair Reminder (Automatically reminds you to repair when entering a resting area)
- Member died bar (Shows a bar when a member in your group dies)
- Brez timer (Shows a timer for when the next brez will be up and how many are available)
- Take the rez (Shows a reminder for when you get a res midfight)


Access most of the optinons using the editmode (the rest are accessed by typing /mplusqol).
